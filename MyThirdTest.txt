This class has been one of the hardest classes I have taken at BYU.
I wish I knew how to code this stuff much easier but I don’t have that gift.
Maybe in the future this will only get easier.
Well I’m glad this is the last lab for the semester because now i need more time to study for the final.
Well here goes nothing.
